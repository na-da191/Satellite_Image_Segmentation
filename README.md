# Satellite_Image_Segmentation

The present report is a synthesis of the work carried out within the framework of the
project of Multimedia data processing , carried out within the ENSIAS, a big school
of engineers specialized in Technologies of the Information and the Communication.
Its missions are the training of state engineers and research for the technological and
economic development of Morocco.
The mission we have been given is part of dealing with satellite images that are
special in order to do a segmentation and classification of this type of data that have
become commercially available and have been increasingly used in various aspects of
environmental monitoring and management.
